# CodeAlpha-Internship
I’m currently doing a virtual internship at CodeAlpha, where I have to complete three tasks within a given time. Through this, I’m improving my programming skills by working on real-world projects.
One of my tasks was to build an AI-powered Language Translator with Speech Support using Python, Google Translate API, Speech Recognition, and CustomTkinter for a simple and user-friendly interface.
This tool lets users translate text between different languages, take voice input (speech-to-text), and even read out the translated text (text-to-speech). It helped me learn how to integrate APIs, work with GUI development, and implement AI-based applications in a practical way.
Overall, this internship is giving me hands-on experience with AI, development, and problem-solving while improving my coding skills.
